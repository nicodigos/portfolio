Professionally, I focus on helping grow your business through data and web development, but beyond that, I’m someone with a variety of interests. I love to learn, and over time, I’ve done so in many ways: sometimes through structured learning, but also through brainstorming sessions without a specific order. I’ve learned by reading, but also by listening to others and experiencing life with them, always aiming to contribute something valuable. I’ve grown through both successes and mistakes, learning and refining along the way. Today, I’m proud to be the result of all my experiences and knowledge."
